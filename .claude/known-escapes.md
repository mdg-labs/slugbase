# Known escapes

Defect patterns that passed a `task-verifier` PASS and were later confirmed
real in review (CodeRabbit on a promotion or unit PR). `task-executor` checks
its change against this list before committing; `task-verifier` checks each
commit against it under layers 6 and 7. `cr-review` appends a line whenever it
fixes a confirmed finding whose pattern is not here yet.

One line per pattern: **category** — what goes wrong — where it was seen.
Keep it to patterns, not individual bugs; merge a new instance into an
existing line by adding its PR number.

No patterns recorded yet.
