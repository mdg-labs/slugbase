### Findings outside these items
{{only real problems none of the items above cover and you did not fix: a pre-existing defect with a concrete scenario, a doc statement that is untrue, or work a planned feature cannot do without. One line each — what, where (`file:line` or the command that shows it), the scenario, and why it isn't yours. Not findings: style, hardening you would like, ideas, and tooling missing on this machine. The orchestrator files or routes each one; you never open an item. "none" is the normal answer.}}
