# Roll an epic's status up from its sub-issues.
#
# Called by an executor after it claims a sub-issue, and by a verifier after it
# passes one. Both need the epic to follow along: the epic goes in-progress the
# moment the first sub-issue is picked up, and implemented once the last one
# passes verification.
#
# It is computed, not incremental, and that is the point. Lanes run in
# parallel, so "am I the first?" and "am I the last?" are races an agent cannot
# answer about itself — but the epic's status is a pure function of its
# sub-issues' statuses, so every agent that asks gets the same answer no matter
# what order they ask in, and asking twice is harmless.
#
#   any sub-issue being worked on   → status:in-progress
#   every sub-issue done            → status:implemented
#   nothing started yet             → leave the epic alone
#
# It never sets closed/cancelled — .github/workflows/issue-status.yml owns
# those, when the epic's own last trailer closes it.
